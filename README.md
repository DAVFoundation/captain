# Captain

<img src="./resources/images/logo-captain.jpg" align="right" />

The Captain is the logic that runs onboard vehicles, gives commands to the vehicle, negotiates missions, and communicates with the blockchain.

It demonstrates how a third party might build their own product, while integrating technologies provided by DAV. For example, a drone manufacturer could integrate DAV's SDK directly in their drone's firmware, or a third-party could develop software that would be installed on other companies' drones to help them participate in an autonomous economy.

### The Captain is currently under heavy construction!

If you see anything that can be improved, please feel free to suggest it or send a pull request.

Feel free to **Star** and **Watch** the Captain, but watch out for falling debris, and a wildly changing API.

Feedback and contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
